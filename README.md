# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). They are neither meticulously tested nor polished, they were just working well enough for the purpose of the event. Some provide only part of the answer, and a bit of manual labor was required for the solution.

18a, 18b, 22b and 25b are still missing. Maybe some day...
